# 4-Semester-Project

### Commits, branches & naming
- __Commit messages__ should be as an _instruction_ e.g. `Add login button` instead of `Added login button`

### Slack tricks :fire:
- `linkbot` - Shows all relevants links for the semester project in the Slack channel
- `commands` - Shows all our custom Slack commands
